## Dynmaic programming(memmomization, top down approach)
* Enhanced version of recurssion
* recursion + storage
* how to identify dp problem ?
    * if question asked about choice
    * if recursion has one call in questions then never dp use
    * if resursion has two call then it might be possible to use dp
    * they asked about optimal things like:- min, max, largest, greatest

### questions on DP
* 0-1 knapsack(6)
    * Subset sum
    * equal sum partition
    * count of subset sum
    * minimum subset  sum difference
    * target sum
    * a number of subset given difference
* Unbouned Knapsack(5)
* fibonacci(7)
* LCS(15)
* LIS(10)
* kadanes algorithm(6)
* matrix chain multiplication(7)
* DP on trees(4)
* DP on grid(14)
* Others(5)
